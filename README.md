# Go4Movies
Project as Part of the Software Engineering Course Submission Requirements

Go4Movies is a web-based movie ticket booking platform designed to simulate a real-world, high-traffic e-commerce environment. The application allows users to browse movies, check showtimes, and book specific seats in an interactive theater map.

Core Problem Solved: The primary technical challenge this project solves is the "Race Condition" inherent in booking systems—where multiple users attempt to book the exact same seat at the same millisecond. GoMovies prevents double-booking errors through a robust concurrency control strategy.

Technical Architecture:

Frontend (React + Tailwind): A responsive Single Page Application (SPA) utilizing functional components and Hooks. It renders a dynamic visual seat map and manages complex local state, including reservation countdown timers and immediate visual feedback (e.g., blocking a seat the moment it is taken).

Backend (Go/Golang): A high-performance REST API built with Go (using Chi or Gin). Go would be beneficial for its efficient concurrency model (Goroutines) to handle multiple simultaneous booking requests without blocking.

Database (SQLite): A lightweight relational database. We will  allow concurrent reads and writes, simulating a production-grade database environment.

Concurrency Control: The system implements Optimistic Locking via SQL transactions.

Reservation: When a user clicks a seat, the backend atomically updates the status to RESERVED with a 5-minute expiry.

Conflict Resolution: If User B tries to book the seat while User A holds the lock, the transaction fails, and the API returns a 409 Conflict error.

Cleanup: A background Goroutine runs periodically to expire unpaid reservations, releasing seats back to the pool.

DevOps (Docker): The application is fully containerized. A single docker-compose.yml orchestrates the React frontend (served via Nginx or Vite preview) and the Go binary, ensuring the environment is identical for all developers.
